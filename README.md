## Introduction

We are building a platform that allows college organizations to create a simple platform for their alumni to give back to the organization. In addition, we are going to make designs both low-fi and high-fi, mood boards, data schema and add functionalities using programming languages like html/css, JavaScript and Node Js etc.

## Dependencies

This platform can be accessed using any operating system because it‚Äôs a website which is web based. Our system will be hosted in the cloud and every alumnus can access it everywhere he or she is.
This platform is designed to be intuitive and easy to use across any operating system. We invite you to explore our website, learn about our products and services, and get in touch with us if you have any questions.

2. Registered successfully page
3. Call for action button ‚ÄúDONATE NOW‚Äù | DONATE LATER
4. Download a receipt or download a PDF for a transaction made .

## How our website works

We built our website in such a way that users will need to have a registered account with us to be able to register and donate to fellow students.
When a User enters our Website they get to see the Landing Page. The Landing Page provides a lot of information to all Users (Authenticated Users and Unauthenticated). Information such as;
What are Search a University and Donate?
Who will donate?
How to donate?
Users will need to register on our website to be able to view more details on what our website does. When the alumni finally register on the website, the alumni will be provided a dashboard where he/she would be able to carry out the donation process. The dashboard also provides Users with ‚Äúprofile Setting‚Äù and ‚ÄúLogOut‚Äù options on the side navigation menu.
The alumni will be the one responsible to donate money and this money will help the other fellows at university. Donation is done by registering or logging into our website and on the dashboard alumni will click on donate now or later therefore he or she will be requested to provide payment methods like visa, paypal,bank and many others.
